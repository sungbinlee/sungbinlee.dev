## Hey, I'm Sungbin Lee

I'm a **software developer** based in Seoul, Korea. These days, I spend most of my time building features, improving UX, and thinking about how to make systems more stable and efficient.

I mostly work with **Python**, **Java**, and **JavaScript**, but I’m always open to learning new tools if they’re a better fit. I also try to contribute to open source—bit by bit!

I have another blog at [tech.sungbinlee.dev](https://tech.sungbinlee.dev), where I share study notes and tech learnings I’ve picked up along the way—from college to today.

This blog, though, is more for **writing out my thoughts and sharing personal insights** as I grow in my career. I wanted a space where I could focus on writing itself—so I started this one using **Hugo with Bear Blog** theme. I’m writing in **both Korean and English** to reach more readers—and to improve my English too.

## What I’ll post here:

- Thoughts & reflections from life as a developer  
- Career stuff I’m figuring out  
- Ideas or stories that come up while learning

Thanks for reading! :)
