<h2 id="hey-im-sungbin-lee">Hey, I&rsquo;m Sungbin Lee</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a <strong>software developer</strong> based in Seoul, Korea. These days, I spend most of my time building features, improving UX, and thinking about how to make systems more stable and efficient.</p>
<p>I mostly work with <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, but Iâ€™m always open to learning new tools if theyâ€™re a better fit. I also try to contribute to open sourceâ€”bit by bit!</p>
<p>I have another blog at <a href="https://tech.sungbinlee.dev">tech.sungbinlee.dev</a>, where I share study notes and tech learnings Iâ€™ve picked up along the wayâ€”from college to today.</p>
<p>This blog, though, is more for <strong>writing out my thoughts and sharing personal insights</strong> as I grow in my career. I wanted a space where I could focus on writing itselfâ€”so I started this one using <strong>Hugo with Bear Blog</strong> theme. Iâ€™m writing in <strong>both Korean and English</strong> to reach more readersâ€”and to improve my English too.</p>
<h2 id="what-ill-post-here">What Iâ€™ll post here:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Thoughts &amp; reflections from life as a developer</li>
<li>Career stuff Iâ€™m figuring out</li>
<li>Ideas or stories that come up while learning</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading! :)</p>
